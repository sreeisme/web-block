# web-block

Also, here's how to use the script if you want to run it yourself (make sure you give the script executable permissions and use sudo to run it): 

To block a website, use the --add option followed by the domain name(s):
```sudo ./web_block.sh --add example.com``` 

To unblock a website, use the --remove option followed by the domain name(s):
```sudo ./web_block.sh --remove example.com```
